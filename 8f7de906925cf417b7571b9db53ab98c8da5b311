I thought we are moving this LocalLog dump to WifiService. If the goal is just to remove mWifiNetworkSelector from WSM constructor, we can do something like "mWifiInjector.getWifiNetworkSelector().dump()" here. This way we don't need to make that change to WifiConnectivityManager which simply calls into WifiNetworkSelector.dump().

I put this in the bug already, but I did try this initially.  WifiServiceImpl doesn't have an instance of NetworkSelector either, so it seems odd to put it there.  Additionally, I also noticed that NetworkSelector in the main holder of the LocalLog instance and ConnectivityManager is using the same LocalLog.  This doesn't make a lot of sense.  If ConnectivityManager is the one holding on to and directly calling NetworkSelector, then it should probably be the owner of the log and do the dump call.  Having another class reach around ConnectivityManager to get to NetworkSelector (via WifiInjector) is a bit convoluted.  I am hoping this will be more clear after I get more of the WSM refactor done and then hopefully ConnectivityManager will be a better cut of a subset of code.  For now, I am just trying to get another variable out of WSM and don't want to just stick it in ServiceImpl.

Sorry, I missed your comment in the bug. WifiConnectivityManager and WifiNetworkSelector share a local buffer. However WifiConnectivityManager depends on WifiNetworkSelector, which is initialized then passed to WifiConnectivityManager constructor. That's why the local buffer is created in WifiNetworkSelector.

NetworkSelector is created in WifiInjector, but the only class that directly interacts with it is ConnectivityManager.  No one else holds the NetworkSelector and it is pretty unnatural for another class to reach around ConnectivityManager to get to it.  (It is possible thanks to WifiInjector, but it is awkward.

Depending on how you look at it, WifiNetworkSelector(WNS) and WifiConnectivityManager(WCM) are literally two entities. The job of WNS is to evaluate scan results, regardless of whether they come from WCM or other modules (for example in WNS unit tests the scan results are all mocked and WCM is not there at all). The job of WCM is mainly to schedule connectivity scans. Each class used to have its own LocalLog buffer. We consolidate them into one recently just to make better use of the memory. WNS doesn't have to be always reached via WCM.
