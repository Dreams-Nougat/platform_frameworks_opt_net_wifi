In the case of bypassing ScanMode, I think this would do the trick.  This is not the only option however.  In the situation where we were starting up ClientMode (so we are in SupplicantScanningState, but we see a CMD_SET_OPERATIONAL_MODE for SoftAp (wifi hotspot) we would most likely end up losing the operational mode switch.  This is definitely one of the reasons I am refactoring this code (actively in development).
