This line is too long. (Gerrit should show a dashed red vertical line, indicating the right margin. If not, let's try to figure out why gerrit is misbehaving for you.)

What does this mean? Is Sanity the name of a test suite, or is it some simple manual testing, or something else?

I don't understand the motivation for this part of the change, or for any of the other additions of mLog.trace() calls.

The commit message only talks about the addition of tracing via WifiAsyncChannel, and WifiHandler. If these other changes are intentional, the commit message should mention them.

The reference to these changes (in the commit message) should explain the motivation/strategy for these changes. Is the goal, e.g., to trace every public method?

I guess that "trace every public method" is what this CL is aiming for, because startService() is _not_ traced. And, on the other hand, replyFailed() is not a public method.

But, without knowing the intent, I can't judge whether or not this CL hits the target.
