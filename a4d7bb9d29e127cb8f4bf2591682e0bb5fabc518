(Cont'd from PS3)

Please list WifiHandler here, so that a reader can get the important information by skimming the commit message.

As is, a reviewer will miss this information, unless they very carefully parse the paragraph below.

No need to describe the implementation details of WifiAsyncChannel here. (That code was added in its own CL, with its own explanation of implementation strategy.)

The rest of this commit message is hard to follow.
- Using a single, long, paragraph makes the text hard to skim.
- The relationship between the subtopics of this paragraph, and the goals above is hard to see.
- The paragraph contains information that isn't relevant to this commit. (E.g., implementation details of WifiAsyncChannel, and WifiHandler.)

Please have a look at go/lotl-178, and incorporate some of that advice here. The ideal structure of this commit message might be something like:

   Log API surfaces...

   The following interfaces may be used...
   - AIDL...
   - Async...
   - Handler ...

   We trace these interfaces as follows:
   - AIDL: manual addition of WifiLog.trace() calls
   - AsyncChannel:
     - use of WifiAsyncChannel
     - addition of trace() calls to replySucceeded() and
       replyFailed() calls [1]
   - Handler: use of WifiHandler

   [1] This compensates for the fact that WifiScanningService uses a fully-connected AsyncChannel. In fully-connected mode, replies can't be logged by WifiAsyncChannel, because the replies aren't sent using replyToMessage().

Key features of the structure above:
- easy to skim
- mapping from problem to solution is clear
- most important information is at the top, with greater levels of details as we reader further (e.g., the detail about replyToMessage() is at the bottom).

Similar to comment at line 15: no need to describe the implementation details of other classes.

Recommend leaving this last sentence out. It's unsurprising that a mock was added to a test fixture. So, unless there's something subtle going on, no need to mention this.
