Is this RecommendedNetworkEvaluator going to handle networks that are saved but marked as externally scored?

Yes it will.

Why this evaluator specific input parameter needs to be passed down via WifiConnectivityManager? Can't RecommendedNetworkEvaluator obtain it via NETWORK_SCORE_SERVICE?

RecommendedNetworkEvaluator could obtain NetworkScoreManager from Context, but it is better to inject direct dependencies instead of indirect ones. go/di-practices/inject-direct-dependencies

Using that logic, it would make more sense to actually inject SavedNetworkEvaluator, RecommendedNetworkEvaluator and ExternalScoreEvaluator directly into WifiConnectivityManager instead of constructing those objects within this constructor. I'd be happy to make that change in this commit if you agree. That would remove the WifiNetworkScoreCache and NetworkScoreManager arguments and add ones for the 3 evaluators.

Why does WifiConnectivityManager need to know whether ExternalScoreEvaluator or RecommendedNetworkEvaluator should be employed?  Shouldn't this be an implementation detail of ExternalScoreEvaluator, or perhaps an factory object?

The goal is to fully replace ExternalScoreEvaluator with RecommendedNetworkEvaluator. The logic for using external scores to recommend a WifiConfiguration will be pushed to the implementors of INetworkRecommendationProvider.

After b/33224286 is fixed, the logic here will simply add a NetworkRecommendationEvaluator to WifiNetworkSelector if NETWORK_RECOMMENDATIONS_ENABLED is set (ExternalScoreEvaluator will be deleted).  I think this an appropriate place to put this logic since all of the NetworkEvaluators are created here.
