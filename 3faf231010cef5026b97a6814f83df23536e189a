Why does WifiConnectivityManager need to know whether ExternalScoreEvaluator or RecommendedNetworkEvaluator should be employed?  Shouldn't this be an implementation detail of ExternalScoreEvaluator, or perhaps an factory object?

The goal is to fully replace ExternalScoreEvaluator with RecommendedNetworkEvaluator. The logic for using external scores to recommend a WifiConfiguration will be pushed to the implementors of INetworkRecommendationProvider.

After b/33224286 is fixed, the logic here will simply add a NetworkRecommendationEvaluator to WifiNetworkSelector if NETWORK_RECOMMENDATIONS_ENABLED is set (ExternalScoreEvaluator will be deleted).  I think this an appropriate place to put this logic since all of the NetworkEvaluators are created here.
