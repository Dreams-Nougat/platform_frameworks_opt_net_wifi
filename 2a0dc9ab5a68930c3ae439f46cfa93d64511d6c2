I know you mentioned that you've gone with a |protected| field here, to avoid the need to pass a WifiInjector into WifiHandler.

Could you elaborate, though, on what problems we'd run into, if we _did_ pass WifiInjector into WifiHandler?

(I'm not necessarily opposed to this approach. But I'd like to understand why we need to diverge from the pattern used in other Wifi code.)
