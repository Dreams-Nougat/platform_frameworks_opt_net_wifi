Can we create the PasspointEventHandler() here itself? We don't need a makePasspointEventHandler if it has no external dependencies.

Don't pass WifiInjector in the constructor. You can create the PasspointEventHandler directly in WifiInjector and pass it to the constructor here. 

WifiInjector is passed into the constructor of a few classes today. We will be removing all of them soon. All the external dependencies for each class should be taken in as a constructor argument. WifiInjector should just create these instances.

This should be changed to directly pass the mock PasspointEventHandler in the constructor. 

There are other tests which do this pattern as well. We should get rid of them.
