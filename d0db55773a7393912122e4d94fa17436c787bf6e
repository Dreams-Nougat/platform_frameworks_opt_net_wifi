I am wondering if we can remove this dependency in WifiNetworkSelector's constructor. I think WifiInfo is only needed in the function WifiNetworkSelector#selectNetwork.   Instead of pass it in the constructor, you can have the caller for selectNetwork (WifiConnetivityManager) to pass it in. 

I think this would avoid the cyclic dependency between WifiNetworkSelector and WifiStateMachine, and makes the construction more easier and cleaner.
